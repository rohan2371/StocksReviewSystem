            <h2>What is CryptoCurrency?</h2>
            <p>
                A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. <br>
                Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. <br>
                A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.<br>

            <h3>Why to buy CryptoCurrency?</h3>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrencies have been described as a transformative technology that could revolutionize a number of industries.<br>
                Because they cannot be printed or seized, cryptocurrencies may also provide a safe store of value.<br>
                However, cryptocurrencies remain highly speculative, and there is no guarantee that they will ever achieve mainstream usage.<br>
                There are several complex security protocols that should be followed carefully before buying cryptocurrency.<br>

            <h2>The different types of crypto generally fall into one of two categories:</h2>
            <p>
                The different types of crypto generally fall into one of two categories:<br>
                <strong>1)  Coins (non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies)</strong>
                
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altcoins usually refer to any coins that are not Bitcoins.<br>
                Bitcoin is a popular digital currency that’s produced by computational solutions to complicated math problems.<br>
                It works separately from a central bank or state entity (i.e., government-backed Treasury).<br><br>
                Some altcoins include:<br><br>
                
                •  Peercoin<br>
                •  Litecoin<br>
                •  Dogecoin<br>
                •  Auroracoin<br>
                •  Namecoin<br><br>
                
                In fact, the name “altcoin” actually means “alternative to Bitcoin.” Namecoin is considered the very first altcoin, created in 2011.<br>
                
                Like Bitcoin, most cryptocurrencies listed here have a limited supply of coins—to keep the balance in check and to reinforce its perceived value. There is a fixed number of Bitcoins that can exist—21 million, as decided by the creator/s of Bitcoin, though some remain to be mined. Once all 21 million are tapped (the number changes when new blocks are mined), that’s it. The only way to bring in more is for Bitcoin’s protocol to allow for it.<br>
                
                Though most altcoins are built upon the same basic framework as Bitcoin, many claim to be better versions of Bitcoin.<br>
                Each system can differ from the next, as they’re created to serve various purposes and applications, and identified in different ways.    <br>
                <strong><br>2)  Tokens</strong>
                
                Unlike altcoins, tokens are created and given out through an Initial Coin Offering, or ICO, very much like a stock offering. They can be represented as:<br>
                <br>
                •  Value tokens (Bitcoins)<br>
                •  Security tokens (to protect your account)<br>
                •  Utility tokens (designated for specific uses)<br>
                <br>
                They are not so much meant to be used as money as they are used to describe a function. Like American dollars, they represent value but they are not in themselves of value. Tokens are a type of encryption, specifically referring to the long lines of numbers and letters representing the crypto used in a transaction, such as a money transfer or bill payment. In short, tokens cover a number of meanings.<br><br>

                For instance, both Bitcoin and Ether (from Ethereum) are considered crypto tokens.

          <h3>Benefits of CryptoCurrency</h3>
          <p>
            
              <br>
              <strong>1. User Autonomy : </strong><br> Users are able to control how they spend their money without dealing with an intermediary authority like a bank or government.

              <br>
              <strong>2. Discretion : </strong><br>Bitcoin purchases are discreet. Unless a user voluntarily publishes his Bitcoin transactions, his purchases are never associated with his personal identity, much like cash-only purchases, and cannot easily be traced back to him.
              <br>

              <strong>3. Peer-to-Peer Focus : </strong><br>The bitcoin payment system is purely peer-to-peer, meaning that users are able to send and receive payments to or from anyone on the network around the world without requiring approval from any external source or authority.

          <h3>Risks of CryptoCurrency</h3> <br>
          <p>
              <strong>1. Highly volatile : </strong> <br> Unexpected changes in market sentiment can lead to sharp and sudden moves in price. It is not uncommon for the value of cryptocurrencies to quickly drop by hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. <br>
              <strong>2. Unregulated : </strong> <br> Cryptocurrencies are currently unregulated by both governments and central banks. However, recently they have started to attract more attention. For example, there are questions about whether to classify them as a commodity or a virtual currency. Currently, Memes/Articles from twitter are causing losses.<br>
              <strong>3. Susceptible to error and hacking : </strong> <br> There is no perfect way to prevent technical glitches, human error or hacking.
