            <h2>What is Stock Market?</h2>
            <p>
                Stock market is an arrangement where equity shares of companies are bought and sold by the participants. <br>
                The participants can be investors and traders. <br>
                The investors mainly have a long-term horizon in mind and benefit from capital appreciation over the given period. <br>
                Traders, however, earn profits by tapping into small price changes in equity shares which mostly last for a few minutes to the whole trading session. <br>
                In India, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE) are the major platforms where most of the stock trading happens.<br>
                Here, the buyers and sellers place orders through brokers who use online trading services.  <br>
                The settlement cycle follows the T+2 format. <br>
                In this, the trades are executed on Day 1 and the participants receive their shares/sales proceeds after two working days from Day 1.

            <h2>Stock Market Explained Even Simpler:</h2>
            <p>
                Holding stock is like owning a few of the trees in the forest. <br> 
                You can buy more, or sell your trees to others. <br>
                If apple trees become really popular or start growing better than other trees, they may be in high demand, and their prices may rise. <br>
                If the trees are healthy, they’ll slowly grow over time, making them worth more. <br>
                A few times a year, they produce fruit that are valuable.

            <h3>What is a share?</h3>
            <p>
                 The capital of a company is divided into shares. <br> 
                 Each share stands for a unit of ownership. <br>
                 These shares are offered for sale when an organization needs to raise funds. <br>
                 An Initial Public Offering means that a company is making a portion available for traders or investors to buy. <br>
                 Companies benefit from this exercise as they receive the required funds for different purposes.
            </p>

            <h3>Why to buy Stocks?</h3>
