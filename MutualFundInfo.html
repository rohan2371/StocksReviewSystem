            <h2>What is Mutual Fund?</h2>
            <p>
                A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors 
                and invests the money in securities such as stocks, bonds, and 
                short-term debt.
                <br>
                The combined holdings of the mutual fund are 
                known as its portfolio.
                <br> 
                Investors buy shares in mutual funds. 
                <br> 
                Each share represents an investor’s part ownership in the fund 
                and the income it generates.

            <h3>Why to buy Mutual Funds?</h3>
            <p>
                Mutual funds are a popular choice among investors because they generally offer the following features:
                <br>
                <strong>Professional Management : </strong>
                The fund managers do the research for you. They select the securities and monitor the performance.
                <br>
                <strong>Diversification : </strong> “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” Mutual funds typically invest in a range of companies and industries. This helps to lower your risk if one company fails.
                <br>
                <strong>Affordability : </strong>
                Most mutual funds set a relatively low dollar amount for initial investment and subsequent purchases.
                <br>
                <strong>Liquidity : </strong>
                Mutual fund investors can easily redeem their shares at any time, for the current net asset value (NAV) plus any redemption fees.

            <h2>Types Of Mutual Fund?</h2>
            <h4>Four Categories : </h4>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Money market funds</strong> have relatively low risks. By law, they can invest only in certain high-quality, short-term investments issued by U.S. corporations, and federal, state and local governments.
                <br><strong>2. Bond funds</strong> have higher risks than money market funds because they typically aim to produce higher returns. Because there are many different types of bonds, the risks and rewards of bond funds can vary dramatically.
                <br><strong>3. Stock funds</strong> invest in corporate stocks. Not all stock funds are the same. Some examples are:
                <br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Growth funds</strong> focus on stocks that may not pay a regular dividend but have potential for above-average financial gains.
                <br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Income funds</strong> invest in stocks that pay regular dividends.
                <br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Index funds</strong> track a particular market index such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
                <br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Sector funds</strong> specialize in a particular industry segment.
                <br><strong>4. Target date funds</strong> hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments. Over time, the mix gradually shifts according to the fund’s strategy. Target date funds, sometimes known as lifecycle funds, are designed for individuals with particular retirement dates in mind.

          <h3>Benefits of mutual funds</h3>
          <p>
            Mutual funds offer professional investment management and potential diversification. They also offer three ways to earn money.
              <br>
              <strong>1. Dividend Payments : </strong><br> A fund may earn income from dividends on stock or interest on bonds. The fund then pays the shareholders nearly all the income, less expenses.

              <br>
              <strong>2. Capital Gains Distributions : </strong><br>The price of the securities in a fund may increase. When a fund sells a security that has increased in price, the fund has a capital gain. At the end of the year, the fund distributes these capital gains, minus any capital losses, to investors.
              <br>

              <strong>3. Increased NAV : </strong><br>If the market value of a fund’s portfolio increases, after deducting expenses, then the value of the fund and its shares increases. The higher NAV reflects the higher value of your investment.
          </p>

          <h3>Risks of mutual funds</h3>
          <p>
              All funds carry some level of risk. <br> 
              <strong>1. Concentration Risk</strong> Concentration generally means focusing on just one thing. Concentrating a considerable amount of a person’s investment in one particular scheme is never a good option. Profits will be huge if lucky, but the losses will be pronounced at times. <br>
              <strong>2. Interest Rate Risk</strong> Interest rate changes depending on the credit available with lenders and the demand from borrowers. They are inversely related to each other. Increase in the interest rates during the investment period may result in a reduction of the price of securities. <br>
              <strong>3. Liquidity Risk</strong> Liquidity risk refers to the difficulty to redeem an investment without incurring a loss in the value of the instrument. It can also occur when a seller is unable to find a buyer for the security.  <br>
              But past performance can tell you how volatile or stable a fund has been over a period of time. <br>
              The more volatile the fund, the higher the investment risk.
