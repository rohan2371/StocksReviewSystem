            <h2>BULL RACE HALTS!!! 13 Billion Dollars Lost By Tycoon. </h2>
            <p>
                Gautam Adani’s debt-fuelled empire received a jolt this week when a newspaper reported that three of the six Mauritius-based funds that have invested most of their money in the Indian billionaire’s stocks had seen their accounts frozen by the national share depository. The Adani Group refuted the report as “blatantly erroneous", helping to put a floor below plunging share prices. But not before $6 billion of wealth was lost on Monday. The jitters returned the next day with an announcement that the accounts for Cresta Fund, Albula Investment Fund and APMS Investment Fund are in “suspended for debit" status as per a Securities and Exchange Board of India regulation. Adani Total Gas Ltd, Adani Power Ltd and Adani Transmission Ltd all fell by their 5% daily limit in Mumbai on Tuesday.

            <h2>Small Finance Banks receive fresh credit requests from MFIs after RBI’s PSL classification</h2>
            <p>
                Small Finance Banks (SFBs) are getting fresh credit requests from smaller micro-finance institutions (MFIs) for on-lending after the Reserve Bank of India in May allowed priority sector lending classification to fresh credit extended by these banks to micro-lenders. After getting the proposals from MFIs, SFBs have started the process of offering fresh credit facilities under priority sector lending (PSL).

            <h3>UN climate talks hit a wall over tensions about finance</h3>
            <p>
                Tensions over climate finance threaten to derail this year’s COP26 summit after weeks of preliminary UN deliberations yielded little agreement over how to proceed with core principles of the Paris climate accord.

                The downbeat conclusion fuels further disappointment about progress on halting global warming, after the G7 leaders summit in Cornwall failed to produce specific plans for new climate funding.

                A major reason for the discord is that rich countries appear to have missed a target of $100bn in annual climate aid by 2020, creating mistrust among the 191 countries that signed the Paris agreement.

                The shortfall in funding also sets the scene for a series of difficult discussions in November at the COP26 in Glasgow when it comes to agreeing new goals for climate finance.

            <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo's Old Video Endorsing Coca Cola Goes Viral, Fans Call Him 'Hypocrite'   </h2>
            <p>
                Cristiano Ronaldo may have proved Edward Lorenz’s ‘Butterfly Effect’ right - by moving a single Coca-Cola bottle. Ahead of Portugal’s Euro 2020 opener against Hungary, captain Cristiano Ronaldo moved two bottles of Coca-Cola during a press conference on June 15 and then raised a bottle of water. The Portuguese star did not appear to be a fan of the carbonated soft drinks after kept in front of him at a Euro 2020 press conference, encouraging people to drink water instead. The 36-year-old moved the cola bottles aside as he sat down to speak to the media ahead of their Group F opener against Hungary. He followed it by holding a bottle of water before shouting in Portuguese: ‘Agua!’ This simple action led to Coca-Cola losing shares worth $4 billion in the market.
